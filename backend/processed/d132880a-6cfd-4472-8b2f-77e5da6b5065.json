Tampering of Votes\nb. Lack of transparency\nc. Delayed results\nd. Vulnerability to centralized control. \nThe above listed issues undermine public trust in elections and\ncan lead to disputes, creating the need for a secure, transparent,\nand tamper-proof voting system that ensures vote integrity, real-\ntime verifiability, voter privacy, and resistance to manipulation. \nA blockchain and smart contract-based solution can achieve this\nthrough decentralized vote recording, cryptographic verification,\nand automated result tallying, ensuring trust and efficiency.\nP a g e  2\nSYSTEM ARCHITECTURE\nAND UML DIAGRAM\nP a g e  3\nPROCESS OF VOTING\nSecurity & Integrity: Cryptography prevents\ntampering\nTransparency: Votes visible on blockchain\n(anonymous)\nScalability: Handle millions of voters\nAnonymity & Privacy: Protect voter identity\nAccessibility: Simple, user-friendly interface\nAutomates voting rules (eligibility, one vote per\nperson)\nImmutable execution (rules canâ€™t be altered)\nValidates and rejects duplicate/invalid votes\nTransparent tallying of votes\nRemoves intermediaries (trustless system)\nSMART CONTRACTS IN\nVOTING\nDESIGN CONSIDERATION\nP a g e  4\nVoter Entity in Election\nAn eligible citizen who must register their details within a\nspecific time window. Their registration requires\nverification by their local Election Officer. Once approved,\nthey can cast a single vote during the election period.\nTo be eligible to vote in the election, an individual must:\n1.Register their details within the designated time frame.\n2.Be successfully verified and approved by the Election\nOfficer of their constituency.\nCandidate Entity in the Election\nAn individual running for office who must register with their\ndetails, party, and a security deposit during a set period\nand they must also be verified by their constituency's\nElection Officer. Here only verified candidates can contest\nand receive votes.\nTo be eligible to contest for election, an individual must:\n1.Register with their personal details, party affiliation, and a\nsecurity deposit within the designated time frame.\n2.Be successfully verified and approved by the Election\nOfficer of their constituency.\n3.Only after meeting both criteria is a candidate officially\nallowed to contest and receive votes.\nElection Commission (EC) in Election\nElection Commissioner (EC): The highest authority.\nAppoints Election Officers and holds emergency system-\nwide powers.\nElection Officers (EO): Appointed by the EC to manage a\nsingle constituency. They verify local voters and\ncandidates and initiate the vote count for their area.E N T I T I E S  I N  T H E  E L E C T I O N  P R O C E S S\nP a g e  5\nTransparency: Every step, starting from registration to the final vote,\nis recorded on an immutable ledger and creates a public and verifiable\naudit trail, proving the process was followed correctly without\ncompromising voter secrecy.\nSecurity: Sensitive identities are protected using cryptographic\nhashes instead of being stored directly. Smart contracts enforce strict\naccess controls, preventing unauthorized actions and tampering.\nAutomation & Accuracy: The vote tallying process is automated,\neliminating human error from manual counting and enabling the rapid\nand precise delivery of results.\nAudibility: The entire election lifecycle is permanently logged on the\nblockchain, providing a clear and chronological record of all significant\nactions for complete and trustworthy auditing.\nB E N E F I T S  O F  A  B L O C K C H A I N  B A S E D  A P P R O A C H  F O R\nA  V O T I N G  S Y S T E M\nScalability: Storing large lists of voters and candidates directly on-\nchain is inefficient. As participant numbers grow, transaction fees\nwould become prohibitively expensive, making the system unworkable\nfor large-scale elections.\nCost: Every action, from registration to voting, requires a transaction\nfee in the form of (\"gas\"), hence in a major election, the total cost\ncould become a significant financial barrier for both the administration\nand the public.\nUser Experience (UX): Requiring the general public to manage\ncryptographic wallets and private keys is a major technical hurdle that\ncould lower participation and lead to lost voting rights if keys are\nmisplaced.\nCentralization of Power: While voting is decentralized, administrative\ncontrol is concentrated in the single Election Commissioner role. If this\naccount were compromised, it would become a single point of failure,\njeopardizing the entire election's integrity.\nL I M I T A T I O N S  O F  A  B L O C K C H A I N  B A S E D  A P P R O A C H\nF O R  A  V O T I N G  S Y S T E M\nP a g e  6\nTHANK YOUP a g e  7\nG i t H u b  L i n k",
